          Portrait photography can feel intimidating for beginners, but with a
          few simple tricks, you can create professional-looking images. From
          choosing natural lighting to guiding your subject into comfortable
          poses, these 10 tips will help you level up your portrait game.

        One of the first things to focus on is understanding light. Natural
        light, especially during the golden hour (shortly after sunrise or
        before sunset), adds a soft and flattering glow to portraits. If you’re
        shooting indoors, try positioning your subject near a large window with
        diffused light. This avoids harsh shadows and creates a natural,
        pleasing look. Remember, light is the most powerful tool in photography
        — learning to control and use it well can instantly transform your
        shots.

        alt="Blog detail"

        className=" w-full h-auto"
      />

      {/* More Content */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-white leading-relaxed text-justify">
        <p>
          Another important aspect is building comfort with your subject.
          Portraits are not just about how a person looks but also about
          capturing their personality. A relaxed subject will always result in
          better photos. Spend a few minutes chatting with them before the
          shoot, give gentle directions, and encourage natural movements. Even
          simple prompts like asking them to look slightly away or to laugh can
          make the portraits feel more genuine and alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, pay attention to composition and background. A cluttered or
          distracting background can take attention away from your subject.
          Using a wide aperture (like f/1.8 or f/2.8) helps blur the background
          and make your subject stand out. Experiment with different angles and
          perspectives — sometimes moving just a few steps to the side or
          shooting from a lower angle can add drama and interest to your photos.
